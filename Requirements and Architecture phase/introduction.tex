In this project we are supposed to choose between making a functioning multiplayer game for either Android, Iphone or XNA, or make a robot simulator. 

The documentation phase is intended for planning of the chosen architecture design for the development of the game for this project.

\subsection{Project description} 
Our project is a curling game project for Android. The game shall follow simple curling rules and will be a turn-based multiplayer game.

The game will have a simple menu screen with the options to choose between tutorial, play game and exit. The game itself will utilize the touch function on android devices, where you will be able to send the ball with a given speed and manipulate the speed with swiping near the ball, either to decrease the friction for it to go longer or to add or subtract spin. to give the player a better feeling of how well he/she is doing the game when played will have a minimap to give a better overall view of the game. 

The tutorial will guide the player through the rules of curling and how the physics inn the game works.
