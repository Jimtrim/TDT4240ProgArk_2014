For this project we are supposed to choose between making a multiplayer game for either Android, Iphone or XNA, or make a robot simulator. 

The documentation phase is intended for planning of the chosen architecture design for the development of the game for this project.

\subsection{Project description} 
Our project is a curling game project for Android. The game should follow official curling rules and will be a turn-based multiplayer game.

The game will have a simple menu screen with the options to choose between play, tutorial and settings. The game itself will utilize the touch function on android devices, where the end-user will be able to slide the curling stone with a given speed and manipulate the speed by touch. By swiping your finger near the stone, it will either decrease the friction for it to go longer or to spin it, depending where you touch. The minimap is also used to give a better overall view of the game.

The tutorial will guide the player through the rules of curling and how the physics in the game works.
