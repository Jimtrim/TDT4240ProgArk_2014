\subsection{Architectural Tactics}

One of our quality requirements goes directly at reducing coupling so, the tactics we plan on useing are the following; encapsulate, restrict dependencies, refactor and use abstract common services. These tactics work to increase the modifiability which is one of our QA.

To ensure that the usability does not fall behind we plan on giving the player the option to cancel a game and give the player the option to pause.
