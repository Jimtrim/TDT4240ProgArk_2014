\subsection{Issues}

Coming up with an architecture for a small game project doesn’t bring along the biggest issues. The architecture has been made simple for higher modifiability and usability. 

Experience is our greatest issue. The initial architecture we’ve chosen for our project seems intuitive and reasonable for a project this size and purpose, but if it will actually be a solid architecture for a game project like ours we have yet to find out. In addition to this, our group isn’t too familiar with curling as a game and it’s rules, but considering if some of us were more experienced with the game we might have chosen to create a different architecture. 

Initially our group was interested in a networked multiplayer game, but this proved to demand a more advanced architecture which resulted in the group choosing a turn-based multiplayer game. The main arguments was that we wanted to make something that we knew we would be able to pull off so that the main focus could be on learning how to document and make the best architecture possible.
