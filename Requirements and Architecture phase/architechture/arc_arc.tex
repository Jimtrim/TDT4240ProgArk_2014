\subsection{Architectural Rationale}

Our architecture supports the thought of the simpler something is, the better. Thus, our architecture is simple - as is the game we’re developing. It’s also consistent with other similar game applications out on the market today, with simple interface views which are intuitive and similar to other android games, and help new users understand how to use the application from the get-go. The patterns and tactics we have chosen implies that the system will be highly modifiable and to some degree have high usability.
