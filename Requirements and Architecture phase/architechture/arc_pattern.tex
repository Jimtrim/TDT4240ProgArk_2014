\subsection{Architectural and Design Patterns}

Our choice of architectural pattern for our game project will be a model/view/controller-design (MVC) to increase the modifiability of the game. We don't plan on using a specific architectural pattern for usability.\\

To increase the modifiability of our game we plan on using the abstract factory pattern where it seems to fit. For this purpose, a template pattern would be desirable. Since we plan on using the MVC architectural pattern it will be obvious to implement an observer pattern as well. When it comes to increasing usability, there are few patterns to choose from. Consequently we intend to design the graphical interface such that the user will easily and intuitively achieve our quality requirement of learning the game in less than 10 minutes.\\
